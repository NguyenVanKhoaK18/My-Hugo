Executive Summary TaskHub is a task and progress management platform designed to help working groups or small to medium-sized businesses manage work, deadlines, and progress in a visual and secure manner.\nThe system is developed following the DevSecOps model, built entirely on AWS Serverless, ensuring scalability, security, and cost optimization.\nThe development and deployment process uses AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild to automate CI/CD and security testing.\n2. Problem Statement Problem:\nSmall businesses and project teams often struggle with managing workload, tracking progress, and distributing tasks among members. Popular management tools like Jira or Asana often have high costs and lack seamless support for DevSecOps processes or the AWS environment. Solution:\nTaskHub uses a Serverless architecture on AWS to build a lightweight, secure, and cost-effective platform. The platform is developed using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, Cognito, and S3/CloudFront, while integrating AWS CodePipeline for CI/CD and dynamic security testing. Benefits and Return on Investment (ROI)\nThe TaskHub solution brings many practical benefits for development teams and small to medium-sized businesses. The system serves as a central platform for managing tasks, tracking progress, and delegating authority to members effectively. The application of the serverless model on AWS helps minimize operating costs, optimize resources, and increase scalability as usage demand grows. Furthermore, this platform supports building a practical DevSecOps environment, paving the way for research and development teams to expand further projects. According to estimates from the AWS Pricing Calculator, the system\u0026rsquo;s operating cost is only about $0.66 per month, equivalent to $7.92 per year, while the entire initial infrastructure leverages shared services from AWS, with no additional hardware costs. The expected payback period is achieved within 6-12 months due to significantly reduced manual management work and optimized internal workflow.\n3. Solution Architecture The TaskHub platform is built based on AWS Serverless architecture, ensuring operational scalability, high performance, and cost-effective operation. The system focuses on task management, teamwork, and real-time project progress, while maintaining an automated development and deployment process through the DevSecOps model.\nThe overall architecture includes key components such as Amazon API Gateway taking responsibility for receiving and distributing user requests, AWS Lambda handling business logic backend and interacting with the Amazon DynamoDB database to store task information, users, and access permissions.\nThe web interface is hosted via Amazon S3 and distributed globally by Amazon CloudFront, while AWS Cognito ensures authentication and user authorization.\nThe CI/CD process is automated using AWS CodePipeline combined with AWS CodeBuild, enabling continuous development deployment and security testing without server management.\nThe entire architecture is protected by AWS WAF and AWS KMS to enhance data security and ensure additional DevSecOps compliance. AWS X-Ray is used to monitor performance and analyze latency. The overall architecture is described in detail in the diagram below:\nAWS Services Used Amazon Route 53: Highly reliable DNS service, routing traffic. AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall): Advanced protection layer, blocking common attacks. Amazon CloudFront: Global distribution of user interface and static content. Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service): Static hosting of the entire web interface source code (Next.js build files). Amazon Cognito: User authentication and authorization management. Amazon API Gateway: Middleware communication layer, performing authentication and routing API requests to Lambda. AWS Lambda: Core business logic processing. Integrated to log activities into CloudWatch Logs. Amazon DynamoDB: High-performance NoSQL database. Data is encrypted using AWS KMS. AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service): Handles asynchronous notifications. AWS Secrets Manager: Secure storage, management, and rotation of secrets. AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, \u0026amp; CodeGuru: CodePipeline/CodeBuild: Building and automating the CI/CD process. CodeBuild runs automated tests and Static Application Security Testing (SAST). AWS CodeGuru: Automated source code analysis tool, integrated into the CI/CD process to provide intelligent recommendations for performance optimization and code quality improvement, especially important in the Lambda environment. AWS CloudFormation: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) service for deploying all resources. AWS CloudWatch Logs \u0026amp; AWS X-Ray: CloudWatch Logs collects logs. CloudWatch uses this data to set up alerts. AWS X-Ray provides in-depth request tracing capabilities. Component Design User Interface Layer (Frontend):\nInterface: Next.js application built as static files. Hosting \u0026amp; Distribution: Static files are securely stored in Amazon S3 (configured as Origin for CloudFront). This interface is distributed globally by Amazon CloudFront with low latency, while being protected by AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) at the Edge layer. Business Logic Layer (Backend):\nAPI Gateway: Amazon API Gateway receives all requests. It is configured with Cognito Authorizer to validate user tokens before forwarding requests. Processing: Lambda Functions are responsible for handling business logic (CRUD tasks, team management, permissions). Secret Management: Each Lambda function accesses sensitive information (such as external API keys) through AWS Secrets Manager, ensuring secrets are never hard-coded. Data Layer (Database):\nDatabase: Amazon DynamoDB is used to store task data, progress, and user configuration. DynamoDB operates in On-Demand mode for automatic scaling and cost optimization. Data Security: All data at rest in DynamoDB is encrypted using keys managed by AWS KMS (Key Management Service), meeting the highest security standards. Security and Authentication:\nAuthentication: Amazon Cognito provides login mechanisms, session management, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for users. Cognito also supports Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and SSO (Single Sign-On) integration. Edge Protection: AWS WAF is placed in front of CloudFront to prevent Layer 7 DDoS attacks and other common security vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10). Deployment and Monitoring:\nCI/CD DevSecOps: Source code is stored on GitLab (as per the diagram) and automated via the AWS CodePipeline/CodeBuild chain. This process includes running CodeGuru to optimize code before deploying infrastructure via CloudFormation. Monitoring \u0026amp; Debugging: AWS CloudWatch Logs collects detailed logs from all services. AWS CloudWatch uses these logs to set up automatic alerts for errors or incidents. AWS X-Ray provides an overview of transaction flow performance, aiding in debugging and latency optimization. 4.

The largest contributor to startup latency (often called cold start time) is the time Lambda spends initializing your function code. Lambda SnapStart is a feature available for Java, Python, and .NET runtimes that reduces cold start latency from seconds (or higher) to sub-second levels. SnapStart typically requires no or minimal changes to your application code and makes it easier to build responsive and scalable applications without implementing complex performance optimizations.\nIf your function already initializes within a few hundred milliseconds, then AWS recommends using Lambda Provisioned Concurrency to achieve startup latency in the tens of milliseconds.\nWhat is cold start? Lambda runs your function code in an isolated, secure execution environment using Firecracker microVM technology. When you invoke a Lambda function for the first time, Lambda creates a new execution environment for that function to run. Lambda downloads your function code, starts the language runtime environment, and runs the function\u0026rsquo;s initialization code (the code outside the handler). This initialization process (INIT) is called a cold start. Lambda then runs the function\u0026rsquo;s handler code to execute the invocation. The following figure shows the lifecycle of a typical function invocation.\nA Lambda execution environment only processes one function invocation at a time. After the function finishes running, Lambda doesn\u0026rsquo;t immediately stop the execution environment. When your function receives another invocation request, Lambda will attempt to route that request to an idle but already running execution environment. Since the INIT process has already been run for this execution environment, this invocation is called a warm start.\nThe final step of cold start, function code initialization, typically takes the most time. This depends on the startup tasks you perform in your code and the language runtime or framework you use. For languages like Java and .NET, startup latency is affected by just-in-time compilation of static code in loaded classes. For Python, it can be affected if your executed code contains many or large modules.\nPhase 1: Creating a snapshot for your Lambda function When using SnapStart, the Lambda execution environment lifecycle changes. When you enable SnapStart for a specific function, publishing a new function version triggers the snapshot creation process. This process runs the function initialization phase and creates an immutable, encrypted Firecracker microVM snapshot of the initialized execution environment\u0026rsquo;s memory and disk state, then caches and chunks that snapshot for reuse.\nCode branches not executed during initialization, such as classes loaded on-demand through dependency injection, will not be included in the function\u0026rsquo;s snapshot. To improve snapshot effectiveness, proactively execute code branches during the initialization phase, or use runtime hooks to run code before Lambda creates the snapshot.\nSnapshot creation can take several minutes, during which your function version will be in PENDING state, and transitions to ACTIVE when the snapshot is ready.\nWhen you invoke your function subsequently, Lambda will restore new execution environments from this snapshot. This optimization makes function invocation faster and more predictable, as creating a new execution environment no longer requires the initialization process.\nPhase 2: Storing snapshots for low-latency retrieval at Lambda scale Lambda operates at large scale, processing tens of billions of function invocations each month. To efficiently manage and retrieve snapshots at this volume of traffic, Lambda uses storage and caching components. These components include three tiers: Amazon S3 for durable storage, a dedicated distributed cache, and a local cache on Lambda worker nodes.\nLambda stores function snapshots in Amazon S3, chunking them into 512 KB pieces to optimize retrieval latency. Retrieval latency from Amazon S3 can take up to hundreds of milliseconds per 512 KB chunk. Therefore, Lambda uses a two-tier cache to accelerate snapshot retrieval.\nWhen you enable SnapStart, during optimization, Lambda will store snapshot chunks in a layer-two (L2 cache). This tier is a cluster of dedicated distributed cache instances built by Lambda. Lambda stores a separate copy of each snapshot for each AWS Availability Zone (AZ).\nLambda also maintains a layer-one (L1 cache) located on Lambda worker nodes, which are Amazon EC2 instances that process function invocations. This tier is locally available, so it provides the fastest performance, typically 1 millisecond for a 512 KB chunk. Functions with more frequent invocations are more likely to have their snapshot chunks stored in this tier.\nPhase 3: Resuming execution from restored snapshots Resuming execution from snapshots with low latency is the final phase of SnapStart. This phase involves loading the retrieved snapshot chunks into your function\u0026rsquo;s execution environment. Typically, only a small portion of the retrieved snapshot is needed to serve an invocation.\nStoring snapshots as chunks allows Lambda to optimize the resumption process by proactively loading only the small subset of chunks needed. To do this, Lambda tracks and records the snapshot chunks that the function accesses during each invocation, as shown in the following figure.\nAfter the first function invocation, Lambda references this recorded chunk access data for subsequent invocations, as shown in the following figure. Lambda proactively retrieves and loads the \u0026ldquo;working set\u0026rdquo; of these chunks before they are needed for execution. This significantly accelerates cold-start latency.\nUnderstanding SnapStart function performance Function performance improves with more invocations Functions that are invoked more frequently are more likely to have snapshots stored in the L1 tier cache, which provides the fastest retrieval latency. Portions of snapshots that are less accessed for infrequently invoked functions are less likely to be present in the L1 tier, resulting in slower retrieval latency from L2 cache and S3 tiers.\nPreload code branches to optimize snapshot restoration latency To maximize SnapStart benefits, preload dependencies, initialize resources, and perform heavy computational tasks that cause startup latency in your initialization code rather than in the function handler. Code branches not executed during the function\u0026rsquo;s INIT phase will not be included in the function\u0026rsquo;s snapshot.\nPerformance varies depending on function size SnapStart performance depends on how quickly Lambda can retrieve and load cached snapshots into your function\u0026rsquo;s execution environment. Larger function sizes increase snapshot size, and therefore increase the number of chunks, which causes performance to vary for functions of different sizes.\nNot all functions benefit from SnapStart SnapStart is designed to improve startup latency when function initialization takes several seconds, due to language-specific factors or due to initializing and loading software dependencies and frameworks. If your function initializes within a few hundred milliseconds, you are unlikely to see significant performance improvement with SnapStart. For these cases, we recommend using Provisioned Concurrency.\nConclusion AWS Lambda SnapStart can deliver sub-second startup performance for Java, .NET, and Python functions with long initialization times. This post explored how Lambda\u0026rsquo;s lifecycle changes with SnapStart and how Lambda efficiently stores and loads snapshots to improve startup performance.

S3 Bucket 1 Configuration: taskhub-frontend-prod (Frontend Origin) This Bucket serves as the Origin for CloudFront, storing Frontend code (HTML, CSS, JS) and static assets.\n1.1. Access and Bucket Creation Log in to the AWS Console, find and select the Amazon S3 service. Click the \u0026ldquo;Create bucket\u0026rdquo; button. Fill in the general configuration information: Configuration Value Explanation Bucket name taskhub-frontend-prod The Bucket name must be globally unique. AWS Region Asia Pacific (Singapore) ap-southeast-1 Select the geographical region closest to the target users to optimize latency. 1.2. Object Ownership \u0026amp; Public Access Configuration Object Ownership: Select ACLs disabled (recommended). Purpose: Access permissions are managed centrally using a Bucket Policy, simplifying management. Block Public Access settings for this bucket: Action: Uncheck [ ] Block all public access (and all sub-options). Reason: This allows us to configure a Bucket Policy later to grant read-only access specifically to CloudFront OAC (Origin Access Control), ensuring S3 can function as a valid private Origin. 1.3. Versioning and Encryption Configuration Configuration Value Explanation Bucket Versioning Select: Disable Reduces Storage Costs as maintaining multiple versions of Frontend code is unnecessary. Default encryption Enable Ensures data is encrypted when stored (at rest). Encryption type Select: Server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) The default, cost-effective encryption method. Bucket Key Select: Enable Minimizes Request Costs related to the encryption/decryption process. 2. S3 Bucket 2 Configuration: taskhub-files-prod (User Files Storage) This Bucket is used to store files uploaded by users (images, media\u0026hellip;). Maximum security is prioritized. The creation process is similar to the S3 Bucket above.\n2.1. Access and Bucket Creation Repeat the Bucket creation steps (Section 1.1). Bucket name: taskhub-files-prod AWS Region: Asia Pacific (Singapore) ap-southeast-1 2.2. Public Access Configuration (SECURITY DIFFERENCE) Block Public Access settings for this bucket: Keep [X] Block all public access (CHECK ALL). Reason: This is a Secure Bucket containing user data. Files MUST NOT be publicly accessible. Access will only be temporarily granted via Pre-signed URLs generated by the Backend API after authentication. 2.3. Versioning and Encryption Configuration (Similar) Configuration Value Explanation Bucket Versioning Select: Disable Prevents rapid storage cost increases when users update/delete files. Default encryption Enable Data encryption is mandatory for user data. Encryption type Select: Server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) Standard S3 encryption. Bucket Key Select: Enable Reduces encryption request costs.

S3 PREREQUISITES CHECK Before finalizing CloudFront setup, you must ensure the S3 Bucket taskhub-frontend-prod is protected and configured correctly.\n1.1. Static Website Hosting Status Check: The Properties tab of the S3 Bucket. Status: S3 static website hosting must be in the Disabled state. Explanation: Since CloudFront acts as the CDN, Static Website Hosting is not required on S3. S3 merely serves as the content repository (Origin). 1.2. Block Public Access \u0026amp; Bucket Policy Check: The Permissions tab of the S3 Bucket. Block public access (bucket settings): Must be in the On state (Block all public access). Bucket policy (Final Confirmation): Must contain the OAC Policy that is automatically updated by CloudFront . 2. CLOUDFRONT DISTRIBUTION CONFIGURATION 2.1. Step 1 \u0026amp; 2: Get started Configuration Value Explanation Action Click \u0026ldquo;Create distribution\u0026rdquo;. Start the CDN creation process. Plan Select Free Plan ($0/month). The free plan for the project. Distribution name taskhub-frontend-cdn A memorable name for the resource. Distribution type Single website or app. The appropriate type for a Frontend application. 2.2. Step 3: Specify origin (OAC Setup) 1. Specify Origin Origin type: Select Amazon S3. S3 origin: Select the S3 Bucket taskhub-frontend-prod. 2. Configure OAC (Automatic Security) Tick \u0026ldquo;Allow private S3 bucket access to CloudFront - Recommended\u0026rdquo;. Select Use recommended origin settings. Explanation: Upon completing the Distribution creation, CloudFront will automatically update the S3 Bucket Policy to grant access via OAC. 3. Cache Configuration Cache settings: Select Use recommended cache settings tailored to serving S3 content. Default Root Object: Enter index.html (Standard configuration for SPA). 2.3. Step 4 \u0026amp; 5: Security \u0026amp; TLS Configuration Applied Value Explanation WAF Uncheck paid features. Keeping defaults for the project. Viewer protocol policy Redirect HTTP to HTTPS Mandates the use of the secure protocol. Custom SSL certificate Default CloudFront Certificate Activates free HTTPS. 2.4. Step 6: Review and create 1. Review Origin (Source Confirmation) S3 origin: taskhub-frontend-prod. (Must ensure the correct Frontend Bucket is selected). Grant CloudFront access to origin: Must be Yes. (Confirms OAC functionality). 2. Final Configuration Price Class: Select Use all edge locations (best performance). Click the \u0026ldquo;Create distribution\u0026rdquo; button to deploy. 3. POST-DEPLOYMENT CHECK: OAC SECURITY CONFIRMATION After the Distribution status changes to Deploying, perform this crucial check to confirm that OAC is functional:\nAccess S3 Bucket taskhub-frontend-prod. Navigate to the \u0026ldquo;Permissions\u0026rdquo; tab. Find the \u0026ldquo;Bucket policy\u0026rdquo; section. Confirm: The Policy must be automatically updated and contain the JSON statement authorizing the CloudFront service. This confirms that OAC has blocked direct access and only allows CloudFront to read the files.
