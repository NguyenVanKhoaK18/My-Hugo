During my internship at **AWS VIETNAM CO., LTD** from **08/09** to **09/12**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge I acquired at university to a real working environment.  
I participated in **building and deploying cloud infrastructure for web applications using AWS services**, through which I improved my skills in **cloud architecture design, infrastructure as code management, monitoring and troubleshooting, technical documentation, and teamwork in DevOps environments**.  

Regarding work attitude, I always strive to complete tasks well, comply with regulations, and actively communicate with colleagues to improve work efficiency.
