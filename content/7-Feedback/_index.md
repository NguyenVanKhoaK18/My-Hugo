>We highly value your honest feedback about your experience participating in the First Cloud Journey program. Your insights will help us improve the program quality and deliver better value for future participants:

### Overall Assessment

**1. Work Environment**  
The FCJ environment is quite dynamic and professional. Everyone is focused on their work and has a strong learning spirit. The workspace is equipped with modern tools, especially cloud computing resources. What impressed me most is the application of best practices in workflows from the very beginning.

**2. Mentor / Team Admin Support**  
Mentors have deep experience in AWS and cloud architecture, regularly sharing real case studies from deployed projects. Team admins are very organized in managing timelines and resources. However, sometimes I feel we need more 1-on-1 time to discuss technical challenges in depth.

**3. Alignment Between Work and Academic Background**  
The FCJ program helps me directly apply knowledge about networking, databases, and system design to real cloud environments. Particularly, working with AWS services like EC2, S3, RDS has expanded my perspective on cloud infrastructure.

**4. Learning Opportunities & Skill Development**  
I've mastered AWS core services, learned to design scalable architecture, and gained better understanding of cost optimization. Beyond technical skills, I've also developed documentation and presentation skills when presenting solutions to the team.

**5. Culture & Team Spirit**  
The FCJ team has a culture of continuous learning and knowledge sharing. People regularly organize tech talks, sharing about latest AWS updates and best practices. However, I think the team could enhance collaborative projects so everyone has more opportunities to work together.

**6. Policies / Benefits for Interns**  
The program provides AWS credits for hands-on practice, learning materials, and access to AWS training courses. Participating in AWS events and webinars is also a great benefit for professional development.


### Additional Questions
- **Most satisfying aspect**: Getting hands-on with real AWS infrastructure and seeing the results of my work deployed live on the cloud.
- **Areas for improvement**: Should add more workshops on advanced topics like Kubernetes, serverless architecture, and DevOps practices.
- **Would you recommend to friends**: Yes, especially for those wanting to transition to cloud engineering or pursue AWS certification.


### Suggestions & Expectations
- **Experience improvements**: Add sessions on troubleshooting and monitoring, as well as case studies on disaster recovery.
- **Continue the program**: Yes, I'd like to participate in advanced tracks on solution architecture or DevOps.
- **Other feedback**: Should have long-term mentorship programs and networking opportunities with the Vietnamese AWS community.
